**Question statement:** *Create a 2-D navigation diagram for a robot. Implement the same in a program that uses a data structure and depicts the step-wise movement of the robot. Present the working program and the output in a practical session. You can be as innovative as you can. Remember to justify any assumptions of the representations about the location/data/move in the 'mind' of the robot that spells out the computation. 
You can try for a general-purpose program that takes an input and prints the states as output that is involved in moving from (x,y) to (w,z) for example.*

I came up with an HTML5-Javascript game that mimics the chapter 2 implementation of The Computer and The Mind by Laird (1988). In the game I built, the user may behave as the robot entity (yellow dot) and move it across four directions (wherever possible) on the 2D grid. The two stacks tracking the movements of the robot have also been visualized to further explain the need of the memory to backtrack the initial square to which the robot belonged. The game may be played [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/sidgupta234/robot_stack_game/b8b19e7abbf098d39e94b5b2d464e6a81fb4c0fe/index.html) (Press W(up), A(left), S(down), D(right) for moving the robot in the respective direction). And the Github repository with the coded-up HTML and Javascript file is hosted at [github.com/sidgupta234/robot_stack_game](https://github.com/sidgupta234/robot_stack_game)
